                    Hello, Busy Bees! I‚Äôm Hemalatha Thangavel. With a B.Tech in Biotechnology, my academic background might seem unconventional for a crafter, but it has enriched my creative journey in unique ways.Growing up in a traditional family, I often found myself searching for inspiration in unexpected places. I discovered my creative spark in the beauty of the world around me. 
            
                    One of my fondest memories is creating greeting cards for my teachers and friends. Their smiles and appreciation for my work were priceless moments that inspired me to keep pushing my creative boundaries. Crafting allows me to express myself and connect with others, and I‚Äôm excited to share this journey with you!

                <p>My passion for drawing is a vital part of my creative expression. It allows me to translate my thoughts and emotions into visual art, capturing the beauty I see in the world around me. Each stroke of the pencil  is an exploration of my imagination, enabling me to communicate ideas and feelings that words often cannot convey. Drawing not only brings me joy but also serves inspiring me to continue evolving my skills and artistic vision.</p>

                <p>Wire basket weaving has become a captivating craft that combines functionality with artistic expression.
